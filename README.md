# Learning Rust
Programs and materials used for Rust learning and training.

# Repo Structure
All examples are available inside the `src` directory. This project is created as both binary crate and library crate. That means, both `main.rs` and `lib.rs` files are present. 
`main.ts` file acts as an entry point to the program, in case you want to execute all the examples. `lib.rs` acts as the wrapper program to the examples. 

For ease of reference, source code for each area is grouped under separate packages. Each package has a wrapper function ( in the format `run_*_examples`), which acts as an entry point to the examples of that particular package. 
Each example is wrapped inside a separate function that can be executed independently (except in a few cases, which are explicitly mentioned in the code )

# Prerequisites
## Installation
Ensure that Rust and required tool chain are installed and configured.

- To install `rustup` (on unix based machines)
    - `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
    
    - Above command will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
programming language, and its package manager, `Cargo`.

    - Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at (on UNIX/Linux based machines):

        - /home/<user_dir>/.rustup

    - The Cargo home directory located at:
        - /home/<user_dir>/.cargo

    - The `cargo`, `rustc`, `rustup` and other commands will be added to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:
        - /home/<user_dir>/.cargo/bin

    - This path will be added to PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:
        - /home/<user_dir>/.profile
        - /home/<user_dir>/.bashrc

# Naming Conventions
Please refer to the document [here](https://github.com/bijeshos/learning-rust/blob/master/naming-conventions.md) to know more about the naming conventions to be used in Rust. 

# Useful commands

## To compile
- $ `rustc <file-name>.rs`

## To create a new project with Cargo
- $ `cargo new project_name`
    - This will create a project which contains the following:
        - Cargo.toml
            - configuration file in `Tomâ€™s Obvious, Minimal Language` format   
        - src/main.rs
            - a sample test file

## To build
- $ `cargo build`
    - creates a binary in `target/debug` directory with the project's name
    - Run `./target/debug/<project_name>` to execute

## To compile code and run
- $ `cargo run`
  - To run without any arguments
- $ `cargo run arg1 arg2`
  -  - To run without with arguments (e.g.: `arg1` and `arg2`)

## To check
- $ `cargo check`
    - This checks whether the code is compilable or not 
    - This is much faster than `cargo build`

## Build for release
- $ `cargo build --release`

## Uninstall
- To uninstall `rustup` (on unix based machines)
    - $ `rustup self uninstall`
# Comment style
- The comments in the code are usually kept in separate line above the line it's annotating (exceptions would be mentioned explicitly)

# *work in progress*
- Note: This is a work-in-progress repo. More examples would be added soon.
